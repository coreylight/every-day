    <h2>Musician of the Day: Nikolai Medtner</h2>
    <img id="musician-img" src="https://i.scdn.co/image/13a5d215f57025d38196d22f34422332c22946c3" alt="Nikolai Medtner">
    <p id="musician">Nikolai Medtner was a wonderful music maker from Russia. He played the piano really well and wrote a lot of songs for it. He was born in Moscow and lived a long time ago, from January 1880 to November 1951. Lots of the songs he made are like fairy tales, and he called them "Skazki". Some of these are his most special pieces of music.

Nikolai was one of six kids in his family. His mom and her brother taught him how to play the piano when he was a little boy. Even though people forgot about his music for a while after he passed away, many people now think he was one of the best Russian music makers for the piano.
