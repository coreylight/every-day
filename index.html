  <p id="musician">Motohiko "Toko" Hino was a very talented drummer from Japan. He started learning to play drums when he was just ten years old, and by the time he was seventeen, he was already playing in front of people and getting paid for it. People thought he was so good that a magazine even once said he was the best jazz drummer in all of Japan! He moved to New York in 1978 and made music with some other really good musicians. Sadly, Motohiko got very sick with a disease called cancer and passed away in 1999.

Motohiko Hino loved to make music and did it for most of his life. His dad, who also loved music and dancing, taught him to tap dance when he was a kid. Motohiko wasn't just good at playing drums in Japan, he also played in New York and with other musicians from around the world. He even made his own music albums. But he got very sick with cancer and passed away in 1999. We still remember him because of the amazing music he made.</p>
