    <p id="musician">The Toys were a group of three girls who sang pop songs together. They were from Jamaica, New York and became a group in 1961. The girls in the group were named Barbara Harris, Barbara Parritt, and June Montiero. They were very successful and their most popular song, "A Lover's Concerto," sold more than two million copies!

Barbara Harris was the main singer of the group most of the time. All three girls started singing when they were young, and they first became a singing group in high school, but back then they had two extra members, Betty Stokes and Betty Blocker. When Stokes and Blocker left the group, Barbara, Barbara, and June decided to become a group of three, and named themselves The Toys.</p>
