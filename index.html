  	<p id="musician">Chris Difford is a musician from London, England who was born on November 4, 1954. He's famous for writing songs and playing music in a band called Squeeze. He started the band with a man named Glenn Tilbrook after they met when Chris put an ad in a sweetshop window. Some of their popular songs are "Tempted," "Pulling Mussels (From the Shell)," and "Cool for Cats."

After Squeeze stopped playing together in 1983, Chris continued to write songs. He wrote songs for other people like Jools Holland, Elton John, and Elvis Costello. He even helped make a musical with his songs. He and Glenn started playing music together again in 1985 when Squeeze came back together.
