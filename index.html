    <p id="musician">Anita O'Day was a famous jazz singer. She was born as Anita Belle Colton on October 18, 1919, and she changed her last name to O'Day. She was known for her amazing rhythm and her style of singing. She was different from other female singers because she didn't like to dress in pretty gowns like they did. Instead, she wore outfits like the men in her band wore.

Anita was born in Kansas City, Missouri but she grew up in Chicago, Illinois. She had a tough childhood which made her want to leave home as soon as she could. When she was 14, she started to compete in dance competitions. This gave her the chance to tour around the Midwest. Sometimes, she even got to sing.</p>
