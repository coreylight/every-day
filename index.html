    <p id="musician">Larry Young, also known as Khalid Yasin, was a very talented man who played the jazz organ and sometimes the piano. He was born on October 7, 1940, in Newark, New Jersey and he sadly passed away on March 30, 1978. In his early years, he played music that sounded a lot like a cool artist named Jimmy Smith, but as he got older he started to create a unique way of playing the Hammond B-3, which is a type of organ.

Even when he was still learning at school, Larry was already performing music with a group of singers and a jazz band. He kept practicing and growing and played with many R&amp;B bands during the 1950s as well as some jazz artists. He made several albums of soulful jazz music before he joined a record label named Blue Note, and thatâ€™s when his music started to be more like another gifted jazz artist called John Coltrane. He made his best music during this time and also made several album recordings with a guitarist named Grant Green and a drummer named Elvin Jones.</p>
