    <p id="musician">George Masso was a famous jazz musician who was born on November 17, 1926, and passed away on October 22, 2019. He played the trombone and vibraphone, was a composer, and led bands. He was really good at playing swing style and Dixieland music. George was part of the Jimmy Dorsey Band for a couple of years, around 1948 to 1950. 

George, who was born in Cranston, Rhode Island, started off as a trumpet player but learned to play other musical instruments too. He played with the band of Jimmy Dorsey for two years but then he had to stop because he couldn't make enough money. So, he became a music teacher for a while. He got back to playing music in 1973 with Bobby Hackett and Goodman. He also recorded songs with Barbara Lea, Bob Haggart, and Yank Lawson in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p>
