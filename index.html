  <h2>Musician of the Day: Patrice Rushen</h2>
  <p id="musician">Patrice Louise Rushen is a very talented woman! She can play piano, she can sing, and she can write music. She was born on September 30, 1954 in Los Angeles, California and has been making music since 1973. One of her songs, "Forget Me Nots", was so good it was nominated for a big music award called a Grammy! Not only that, but she's a teacher too, she helps students learn about music at two big schools!

Isn't it amazing? By just three years old she had already started playing the piano! She didn't stop at just one instrument, but she also learned others like flute, keyboards, and percussions. She uses these skills not only to perform but to also make new music. She has even been the leader of the popular music program at a school called the USC Thornton School of Music. She is surely a gifted woman!</p>
