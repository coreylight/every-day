  <p id="musician">Johnette Napolitano is a famous musician from California who sings, writes songs, and plays bass guitar. She is best known for being a part of the rock group called Concrete Blonde. When she was a little girl, her parents knew she was good at music because she could play "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" on piano just by listening to it. She loved music so much that, at age five, she joined an art program at UCLA for really talented kids.

In 1986, Johnette helped create the rock band Concrete Blonde with her friend James Mankey. They made a lot of music together, and some of their songs even became quite popular! However, the band stopped and started a lot, and they haven't made any music together since 2012. But even when the band wasn't working together, Johnette still made music on her own.</p>
