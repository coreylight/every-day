  <p id="musician">Mikey Graham is an Irish singer-songwriter, actor, and record producer. He is best known as a member of the boy band Boyzone. Graham was born on August 15, 1972, in Raheny, Dublin, and grew up with five older sisters and one older brother. Before finding fame as a singer, he worked as a mechanic. Graham auditioned for Boyzone in 1993 and was eventually chosen to be part of the band. He gained a reputation as 'the quiet one' and felt that Boyzone's pop style didn't allow him to explore his own musical interests in rock and folk.

Boyzone is a boy band formed in 1993. Mikey Graham auditioned and became a member after the original line-up changed. Graham felt restricted in the band's pop style and wanted to explore other genres. Throughout his career, he has worked as a musician, singer-songwriter, actor, and music producer.</p>
