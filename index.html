    <p id="musician">Billy Tipton was a famous jazz musician who played the piano and the saxophone. He started playing music on the radio in the 1930s and went on to perform in many dance bands. Billy was also in charge of finding new talent for his record label. In the later part of his life, he had to stop playing music because of a pain in his joints called arthritis. Everyone knew Billy as a man, but after he died, his friends and family found out that he was born a girl named Dorothy. 

When he was in high school, Billy couldn't join the school's all-boys band because he was a girl. It was called Southwest High School. This made him sad and he decided to be like a boy. He even changed his name to Billy and everyone thought he was a boy. He followed his passion for music and became a successful musician. Even when he was not playing music, he kept living as a man.</p>
