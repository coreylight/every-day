    <p id="musician">Bobby Tucker was a very good musician who played the piano. He was born on January 8, 1923, and died on April 12, 2007. He was most known for playing the piano for two famous singers, Billie Holiday and Billy Eckstine. He played for Billie Holiday for three years, from 1946 to 1949, and then played for Billy Eckstine from 1950 to 1993.

Bobby started playing piano for Billie Holiday at a club called the Down Beat Club when another musician didn't want to. He did such a good job that Billie decided to keep him as her pianist. He stopped playing for her in 1949 because her boyfriend threatened him. After that, he started playing piano for Billy Eckstine. He even made music for one of Billy Eckstine's albums. Bobby also made his own album in 1960, called "Too Tough".</p>
