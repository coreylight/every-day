   <p id="musician">Francis Scott Key was an American lawyer, author, and poet from Frederick, Maryland. He is best known for writing the text of the U.S. national anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner." Inspired by the sight of the American flag still flying over Fort McHenry during the War of 1812, Key wrote the poem "Defence of Fort M'Henry," which was later set to music and became the national anthem. Key was also a lawyer and worked on significant cases, including the Burr conspiracy trial, and served as District Attorney for the District of Columbia from 1833 to 1841.

In addition to his accomplishments, it is also noted that Key owned slaves during his lifetime.</p>
