    <p id="musician">Duster Bennett was a famous blues singer and musician from England. He played lots of instruments like the guitar, drums, and harmonica, and even used to play more than one at the same time! Duster was given a special guitar by his friend Peter Green and used it to make his first album. People liked his music a lot, but sadly he died in a car crash when he was 29.

Duster was born in a place called Welshpool in Wales. When he was not much older than you, he was already making music all by himself, just like the old bluesmen he admired. His performances were a mix of songs he wrote himself and popular blues songs, sometimes with a little help from his friends. Apart from making his own music, he also helped other musicians on their albums.</p>
