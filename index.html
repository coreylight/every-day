    <p id="musician">Nathan Gregor Mendel, known as Nate, was born in 1968 and is a famous musician. He plays the bass guitar and is really well-known for being in the rock band Foo Fighters. He also used to be in a band called Sunny Day Real Estate, and made a solo album all by himself called "If I Kill This Thing We're All Going to Eat for a Week". He's been with the Foo Fighters for a very long time, and has played on all their albums.

Nate was born in a place called Richland in Washington. He first learned to play the violin, but when he was 13, he got really interested in rock music and joined a band. His friend, who played guitar, suggested he play the bass. He fell in love with punk music and mostly taught himself how to play, learning from bands like Minor Threat, Black Flag, and Bad Brains. Even though he didn't study traditional bass playing, he enjoyed playing a lot of fast notes.</p>
