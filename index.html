  <p id="musician">D12 is a music group from Detroit that makes rap music. Some of the people in the group are Eminem, Proof, Bizarre, Mr. Porter, Kuniva, and Swifty McVay. They started in 1996 and have made really popular albums. They made a lot of hit songs like "My Band" and "How Come."

Even though they were really successful, they had some tough times. After 2006, Eminem took a break and the band slowed down. The band stopped making music together in 2018 when Eminem released a song saying that D12 was over. Even though they aren't making music together anymore, they had a big impact on rap music.</p>
