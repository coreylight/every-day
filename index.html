        <h2>Musician of the Day: Franz Wilhelm Abt</h2>
        <p id="musician">Franz Wilhelm Abt was a famous German musician and conductor born on December 22, 1819. He wrote a lot of music, especially songs that many people liked to sing. He was also really good at directing choirs and even traveled all over Europe and the United States to work with different groups.

Franz learned to play the piano from his father, who was a church minister. He really liked music and reading about God. When his father died though, he decided to only focus on music. He started to write music and published his work for everyone to enjoy. He also moved to different cities where he led choirs and won many prizes for them. Eventually, he went back to Germany to make even more music.
