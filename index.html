    <p id="musician">Bruce Palmer was a famous musician from Canada. He was famous for playing bass in a band called Buffalo Springfield, a very popular folk rock band. The band was so good that they were put in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997! Bruce Palmer was born in Liverpool, Nova Scotia in Canada on September 9, 1946 but later moved to Toronto. He started his music career in the early 1960s and played with many different bands before joining Buffalo Springfield.

In Toronto, Bruce played with many groups including one called Robbie Lane &amp; The Disciples. Then, he joined Billy Clarkson's band, which had all Black musicians except him. Later, he was part of Jack London &amp; The Sparrows, which later became a band called Steppenwolf. In 1965, Bruce joined a band called The Mynah Birds, where he first met Neil Young, who also became a famous musician. The Mynah Birds even signed a contract with a big music company called Motown Records, but they didn't make any songs because one of their singers was hiding in Toronto to avoid going to war in Vietnam.</p>
