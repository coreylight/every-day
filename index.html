    <h2>Musician of the Day: Keith Moon</h2>
    <p id="musician">Keith Moon was an English rock drummer known for his unique style of playing and his eccentric and destructive behavior. He joined the rock band the Who in 1964 and was recognized for his drumming style, which included tom-toms, cymbal crashes, and drum fills. Moon was also known for smashing his drum kit on stage and destroying hotel rooms during tours. He remained a member of the Who until his death in 1978. Despite his talent and success, Moon faced setbacks and struggled with his behavior throughout the 1970s.

Moon's 21st birthday party in Flint, Michigan, was a notorious example of the decadent behavior exhibited by rock groups. He was infamous for his fascination with blowing up toilets with explosives and destroying television sets. Despite his destructive behavior, Moon was considered one of the earliest rock drummers to regularly use double bass drums in his setup. His drum kit grew in size throughout his career.</p>
