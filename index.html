    <p id="musician">Scott Walker was a very famous singer and songwriter who was from America but lived in England. He was famous for his special voice and his different types of music. In the 1960s, he was a pop icon, which means he was really popular and lots of kids liked his music. Then, he started to make more complicated music that not everyone liked, but it was really special. He lived in England since 1965 and even became a citizen there in 1970.

In the beginning, Scott was part of a music group called the Walker Brothers. After that, he started making music by himself and made albums named "Scott", "Scott 3" and "Scott 4". But then, fewer people started buying his music, so he went back to the Walker Brothers. Later, he started making solo music again but it was very different from before. Even though it was different, people in the UK really liked it and he became even more famous. He kept making music until the year before he died in 2019.</p>
