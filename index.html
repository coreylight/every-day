  <p id="musician">Carmine Appice is a famous American drummer who was born on December 15, 1946. He has played with many famous bands over the years including Vanilla Fudge, Cactus, and Rod Stewart. He even got to join the Classic Drummer Hall of Fame in 2013 and the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 2014. He also has a younger brother named Vinny who is also a drummer. Carmine wrote a popular book about how to play the drums called The Realistic Rock Drum Method, where he teaches about different rock rhythms and other drumming techniques.

Carmine had some classical music training when he was younger and he was inspired by jazz drummers like Buddy Rich and Gene Krupa. He first became really well-known when he was the drummer for a band called Vanilla Fudge in the late 1960s. He not only played the drums but also sang back-up harmonies with the band's bassist, Tim Bogert.</p>
