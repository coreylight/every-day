    <img id="musician-img" src="path-to-image.jpg" alt="Rosalind Ashford">
    <p id="musician">Roz Ashford-Holmes is a singer who was born on September 2, 1943 in Detroit, Michigan. She's known for being part of a singing group called "Martha and the Vandellas". When she was younger, she loved music and danced and sang in her church and at school. She also sang at a local club and at parties with her friends, but they didn't become famous right away.

After a while, a singer named Martha Reeves joined Roz's group and they got serious about their music. They started singing behind another singer named Marvin Gaye. But the records they made didn't make them famous until later. They changed their name a few times before they became "Martha and the Vandellas".+</p>
