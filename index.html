    <p id="musician">David Lovering is a musician and a magician from America who was born on December 6, 1961. He's really good at playing the drums, and used to play for a band called the Pixies. After the Pixies stopped playing together, David drummed for other bands and even did magic shows about science. When the Pixies started playing again in 2004, David went back to being their drummer.

When David was growing up in Massachusetts, he learned to play the drums and played in his school's marching band. David had three big dreams - to be in a rock band, to become an electrical engineer, and to tour with his favorite band, Rush. After finishing high school, David studied electronic engineering and worked at a store where he had a lot of fun playing practical jokes.
