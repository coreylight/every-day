  <h2>Musician of the Day: Charlie Peacock</h2>
  <p id="musician">Charlie Peacock is an American singer, songwriter, pianist, record producer, and author. He was born as Charles William Ashworth in Yuba City, California in 1956. Peacock is known for his albums such as Love Press Ex-Curio, Arc of the Circle, and No Man's Land. He founded the record label re:think, which signed acts like Switchfoot.

Peacock began his music career in the late 1970s, playing jazz piano in a band called The Runners. He met author Frank Kofsky at California State University in Sacramento, which led him to meet various jazz artists. In 1978, songwriter Stephen Holsapple recorded Peacock's vocal compositions, and they began writing songs together. Peacock's music was shared with industry friends, and he eventually signed with A&amp;M Records for a demo recording.</p>
