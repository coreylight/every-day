    <p id="musician">Porter Wayne Wagoner was an American country singer-songwriter and entertainer. He was known for his flashy Nudie and Manuel suits and blond pompadour. Wagoner introduced singer Dolly Parton on his television show, The Porter Wagoner Show, and they became a well-known vocal duo in the late 1960s to early 1970s. He charted 81 singles from 1954 to 1983 and was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2002. Wagoner was born in West Plains, Missouri and began his career performing on radio before signing with RCA Victor.

In the early years of his career, Wagoner's band, the Blue Ridge Boys, performed on radio station KWPM-AM. He was later hired by Si Siman as a performer on KWTO in Springfield, Missouri. Despite experiencing lagging sales, Wagoner continued to perform, even playing in schoolhouses for the gate proceeds. He eventually signed a contract with RCA Victor and went on to have a successful career in country music.</p>
