        <h2>Animal of the Day: Elephant</h2>
        <p>
            Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth. They live in various habitats, including savannas, forests, and deserts. They have excellent memory and can communicate using low-frequency sounds that travel long distances.
        </p>
        <p>
            Elephants are herbivores, which means they eat only plants. They use their trunks for grasping food and water. Their tusks are actually elongated incisor teeth that they use for various tasks, such as digging, defending themselves, and gathering food.
