  <p id="musician">Franz Wüllner was a man from Germany who was really good at playing the piano, composing music, and leading musicians in performing. He even led the first performance of a famous work called "Das Rheingold and Die Walküre" by another composer named Wagner. But Wagner wasn't very happy with Wüllner and preferred other conductors more.

Wüllner was born in a city called Münster and he learned about music in many different cities. In 1856, he began teaching piano at the Munich Conservatory, a music school. He also was the music director of a town from 1858 to 1864, and then taught choir at the Munich School of Music. Later, he became the conductor for the Court Opera. He is often remembered for how he performed two parts of Wagner's Ring cycle, called Rheingold and Walküre.</p>
