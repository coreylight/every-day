    <h2>Musician of the Day: Shaggy 2 Dope</h2>
    <img id="musician-img" src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b27380f6d8525372111ea957e240" alt="Shaggy 2 Dope">
    <p id="musician">Shaggy 2 Dope, whose real name is Joe Utsler, is a rapper, music producer, DJ, podcast host, and professional wrestler. He is part of a music duo called Insane Clown Posse, and also started a record label called Psychopathic Records with his music partner and their former manager. He is also involved in a wrestling company called Juggalo Championship Wrestling.

Before Shaggy became famous, he, Joseph Bruce, and John Utsler, sang in a group called "JJ Boys" and they released a song called "Party at the Top of the Hill". Then, they changed their group's name to "Inner City Posse" and their own names to "Violent J, 2 Dope, and John Kickjazz". They performed at night clubs and made a few albums before they started their own record label in 1991. They also released a musical piece called "Dog Beat" that same year.

    <h2>Word of the Day: </h2>
    <p>{Word}</p>
    <p>Definition: {Definition}</p>
    <p>"{Sentence}"</p>
    <p><a href="archive/2023-10-13.html">Previous Day</a></p>
    <p><a href="archive/2023-10-15.html">Next Day</a></p>


```

Please note that `{Word}` `{Definition}` and `{Sentence}` should be replaced with the actual word of the day, its definition, and the example sentence. The `src` attribute of the `img` tag for the musician's image needs to be filled in as well. It's also important to replace the `Undefined` values for habitat, diet and animal image alt tag with the actual values as well.

Moreover, it appears that the requirement for shape of the day (which was mentioned as square and color mentioned as Glacial Ice) are not correlating directly. I've taken the liberty to set the color of the SVG square to match the color Glacial Ice (`#eae9e7`). This might need adjustment based on actual color representation and requirement.</body></html>
