    <h2>🎵 Musician of the Day - Ray Shulman</h2>
    <p id="musician">Ray Shulman was a musician from England who was really good at playing lots of different instruments. He started a band called Gentle Giant with his brothers Derek and Phil and helped write songs and make records for other bands, too. He was born in 1949, and learned to play his first instrument, the trumpet, from his dad who was in a jazz band. When he got older, he also learned to play violin and guitar. He was even picked to be part of a very important group of young musicians in Great Britain because he was so good at the violin. But, his brother Derek convinced him to join his band instead. They made really popular music and became a different band called Gentle Giant in 1970.
