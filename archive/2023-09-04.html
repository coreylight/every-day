 <p id="musician">Steve Jones is a famous guitar player who was born on September 3, 1955. He played in a popular punk band called the Sex Pistols. After the band broke up, he started a new one called the Professionals with his friend Paul Cook. He also made two solo albums and worked with some other cool musicians. In 1995, he started a band with members of Guns N' Roses and Duran Duran. Rolling Stone even said he was one of the top 100 best guitar players ever!

When Steve was a kid, he lived in London with his mom, who was a hairdresser, and his grandparents. Unfortunately, his dad left when he was really young and he had a difficult childhood. He became friends with Paul Cook, who he would later start a band with. Steve didn't go to school very often and had trouble reading and writing until he was an adult. He got in trouble a lot, but he turned his life around to become a famous musician.</p>
