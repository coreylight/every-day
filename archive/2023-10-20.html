  <p id="musician">Karl Wallinger is a musician from Wales who was born on October 19, 1957. He is famous for being the leader of the band called World Party and also for being part of the Waterboys in the mid-1980s. He wrote a song named "She's the One" that Robbie Williams later sang and made popular. Wallinger can play many instruments and is often the only musician playing in World Party songs. Even though he uses his right hand more, he plays the guitar with his left hand.

Wallinger grew up in Prestatyn, Wales, and later went to a school in Surrey known as Charterhouse. When he was a kid, he really liked the music of the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Bob Dylan, and Love. When he became a musician himself, his songs were influenced by these childhood music heroes. His career in music started in 1977 in his hometown, where he first played the keyboard with a band called Pax before starting his own band called Quasimod.</p>
