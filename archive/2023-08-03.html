    <p id="musician">English singer and songwriter Charli XCX, born Charlotte Emma Aitchison in 1992, rose to fame in 2012 with the hit collaboration "I Love It" with Icona Pop. She signed a recording contract in 2010 and released her debut studio album, True Romance, in 2013. While it received critical acclaim, it did not perform well commercially. In 2014, she achieved success with the singles "Fancy" and "Boom Clap", and released her punk-influenced second album, Sucker. Since 2015, she has been experimenting with a more experimental sound and image, collaborating with producers associated with PC Music. She has released several EPs, mixtapes, and singles in addition to working on her third album.</p>
