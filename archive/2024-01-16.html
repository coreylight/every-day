  <p id="musician">Osmo Tapio Räihälä is a famous music composer from Finland. He was born in 1964 and writes music for instruments that make a modern kind of music. He has written many kinds of music like concertos (which are big musical pieces) for different instruments like viola (a string instrument), oboe (a woodwind instrument), cello (another string instrument), French horn, and bass clarinet. One of his most popular pieces is about a soccer player named Duncan Ferguson.

Osmo didn't start out with art music. When he was younger, he was into rock music! His music has been played all over the world in places like America, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and more. In addition to making music, he's also written a book about why modern music is hard. This book was so good it won a big award in Finland in 2021. He shared in an interview that he has something called synesthesia, which is when your senses are linked. Like, you might 'see' sounds or 'taste' colors!
