    <p id="musician">Ofra Haza was a famous singer from Israel. She was also a songwriter and an actress. People called her the "Madonna of the East" because she was very popular and very good at singing. She was born on November 19, 1957 and she passed away on February 23, 2000. In 2023, a magazine called Rolling Stone said she was one of the greatest singers of all time.

Ofra's music was a mix of traditional Middle Eastern and modern styles, and she loved to use stories and poems from her Jewish culture in her lyrics. She became famous all over the world, especially in Europe and America, and her songs were often played on MTV. She even sang songs for movies! Unfortunately, Ofra got very sick with AIDS and died in 2000, which made a lot of people in Israel very sad.</p>
