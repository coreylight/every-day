    <img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/280dfd047f2567cfc36f3fe6932f41dafa6830cb" alt="Colin Moulding" id="musician-img">
    <p id="musician">Colin Moulding is an English musician who was a member of the rock band XTC. He was a bassist, singer, and songwriter for the band, and wrote their first three charting UK singles. Moulding is self-taught as a bass player and prefers an intuitive approach to writing and playing music. Outside of XTC, he released a solo single in 1980 under the pseudonym "The Colonel". He was also approached by David Gilmour to become Pink Floyd's new bass player but declined the offer.

In addition to his work with XTC, Moulding has collaborated with other artists. He played bass and co-produced a track on the Sam Phillips album Martinis and Bikinis and contributed to Billy Sherwood's Pink Floyd tribute album. Despite being less prolific as a songwriter compared to his bandmate Andy Partridge, Moulding's contributions to XTC helped achieve chart success for the band.</p>
