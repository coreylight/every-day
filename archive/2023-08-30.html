      John McNally, born August 30, 1941, is an English guitarist and former
      member of The Searchers, a significant band in the Mersey sound of the
      1960s. McNally was the longest-standing member of the group, performing
      from 1957 until their retirement in 2019, and again for their 2023
      farewell tour. His love for music began in his childhood when his older
      brother would bring back records from the U.S., leading him to learn the
      guitar under the instruction of Georgie McGee. McNally founded The
      Searchers in 1957 at the suggestion of his friend Tony West. The band,
      initially a skiffle group, evolved into a new iteration in 1959,
      consisting of McNally, Mike Pendergast (Mike Pender), Tony Jackson, Chris
      Crummey (Chris Curtis), and William Francis Beck (Johnny Sandon).
      Following Sandon's exit in 1960, the remaining members toured in Hamburg,
      Germany, signing to Pye Records in 1963.
