<h2>Musician of the Day: Jean-Baptiste Lully</h2>
<p id="musician">Jean-Baptiste Lully was a very talented man from Italy who moved to France. Born on November 28, 1632, he was not just a musician who played the guitar and violin, but also a composer and dancer. He wrote a lot of operas and was especially good at a type of music called French Baroque. He spent most of his life working for a king named Louis XIV and also became friends with a famous playwright named MoliÃ¨re. They made a lot of music and plays together.

When he was younger, Lully lived in a place called Florence with his parents. It's not exactly known who taught him all about music but he once mentioned a nice friar taught him to play the guitar. He also learned how to play the violin. As a boy, he once dressed up as a clown during a big festival called Mardi Gras and played his violin. This caught the attention of a man named Roger de Lorraine.</p>
