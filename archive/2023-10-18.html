        <p id="musician">Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Bruce Mathers III, is a famous American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He was born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri. He is often mentioned as one of the greatest rappers of all time and has been a big part of making hip hop music popular. He has been really successful and people think he helped break down some barriers for white rappers in popular music. 

Eminem started getting famous after releasing his first album, "Infinite," in 1996 and then another record, "Slim Shady EP," in 1997. He also signed with a big music company run by another famous rapper, Dr. Dre. Even though some people didn't like some of his music because it was a little out there, he became a symbol for a lot of people who felt like they weren't being heard or were being mistreated.</p>
