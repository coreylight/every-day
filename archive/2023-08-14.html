        <h2>The Bachelors</h2>
        <p id="musician">The Bachelors were a popular Irish pop group that had several international hits in the 1960s. The founding members were Con Cluskey, Declan Cluskey, and John Stokes. They initially formed as the Harmonichords and later changed their name to the Bachelors. They achieved success with eight top-ten singles in the UK between 1963 and 1966.

The group gained popularity through their appearances on various shows and radio programs. They had a classically styled instrumental harmonica act and played background music on a radio comedy series called Odd Noises. The Bachelors' name was suggested by Dick Rowe, an A&amp;R at Decca Records. They continued to have successful songs throughout the 1960s.</p>
