        <h2>Musician of the Day - Jim Kale</h2>
        <p id="musician">Michael James Kale is a retired Canadian musician best known as the original bassist for the rock band The Guess Who. He was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1987 as a member of the band. Kale joined The Guess Who in 1962 and played bass during their most successful period, co-writing their hit song "American Woman." He left the band in 1972, joined Scrubbaloe Caine, and later formed his own line-ups of The Guess Who for nostalgia tours. 

Kale's nostalgia line-ups of The Guess Who have faced criticism from former bandmates Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings. Despite this, he has continued to lead different versions of the band and tour under The Guess Who name.</p>
