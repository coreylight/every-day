        <h1>Musician of the Day: Craig Gill </h1>
        <p id="musician">The Inspiral Carpets are a group of musicians, or a band, from England who make rock music. This band started in 1983, and some of their most famous members are Tom Hingley, Craig Gill, and Graham Lambert. They are known for using guitars and organs in their music, and their music sounds a bit like old-fashioned rock. The band stopped making music in 2016 when Craig Gill died, but in 2022 they decided to start making music again and go on a tour.

Before becoming the Inspiral Carpets, the band was known as The Furs and they played covers of songs by the Psychedelic Furs. In 1983, two school friends, Graham Lambert and Stephen Holt, formed the band Inspiral Carpets. They first made music that was inspired by garage rock and punk. They played locally in Oldham, and even though some band members had to leave, they found new ones and kept going.</p>

In the place where I've written `${Date()}`, you need to include javascript to format the date, but as you mentioned javascript is not allowed, I've left it here as a placeholder.

Also, please replace the not defined parts in the musician section and the word section with the actual data you want to display.</body></html>
