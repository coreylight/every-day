  <p id="musician">Joshua Bell is a famous American violin player, who was born on December 9, 1967, in Bloomington, Indiana. He also knows how to conduct music, like the leader of a band. Joshua Bell has a special violin called the Gibson Stradivarius that he plays.

When Joshua was little, he loved music so much that he made a homemade violin from rubber bands and a dresser! So, his parents got him a real violin when he was five years old and he started to take lessons. He also liked to play video games and sports like tennis and bowling. By the time he was 12, Joshua knew he really loved the violin and wanted to keep getting better. When he was 14, he even got to play his violin as a soloist with a big orchestra.</p>
