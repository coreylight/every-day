        <h2>Musician of the Day: Kenny Everett</h2>
        <img id="musician-img" src="" alt="Kenny Everett">
        <p id="musician">Kenny Everett, whose real name was Maurice James Christopher Cole, was a popular British radio DJ and a television star. He was not just known for his funny voices and characters but also for his DJing skills. You may have heard of him from BBC Radio 1 where he started in 1967. BBC once told him he couldn't work there anymore because of a joke he made on the radio, but they gave him his job back later on. He even had his own TV comedy show where he worked with a lady named Cleo Rocos.

In addition to his radio and television work, Kenny liked to write his own scripts, create musical jingles, and use high-tech recording equipment. He was also very good at playing games because he was often invited to be on game shows, like Blankety Blank. Besides, Kenny supported the Conservative Party in the UK, which was led by Margaret Thatcher at the time.</p>
