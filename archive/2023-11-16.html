    <p id="musician">Achille Joseph Baquet was a famous American jazz musician who played the clarinet and the saxophone. He was born into a musical family and learned to play from a young age. He played in several jazz bands and even wrote a few songs. He was also special because he was part of a black family but had light skin, so some people thought he was white.

Achille played with the Original Dixieland Jazz Band and Papa Jack Laine's Reliance Brass Band among others. He also worked with a man named Jimmy Durante in the Original New Orleans Jazz Band. People aren't sure if he was a part of another band called the Whiteway Jazz Band. Some of the songs he helped write include "Why Cry Blues" and "Livery Stable Blues".</p>
