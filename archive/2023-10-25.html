  <p id="musician">Jerry Edmonton was a famous musician from Canada who played the drums in a rock band called Steppenwolf. Jerry was born in 1946 and he began his musical journey with a band called The Sparrows, which later changed its name to Steppenwolf. He worked with the band for many years, creating many fantastic songs and even formed other bands when Steppenwolf took a break.

In the 1980s, Jerry got married to the wife of one of his old band mates, Andy Chapin. Tragically, Jerry's life ended in 1993 when he had a car accident in California. During his life, he made a lot of music that people still enjoy today.</p>
