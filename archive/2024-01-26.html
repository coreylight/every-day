    <p id="musician">Charles Valdez "Truck" Parham was a very talented man who was born in Chicago in 1911 and died in 2002. Before he became a famous musician who played the double-bass, he was a professional sports player who boxed and played football. He played in different bands and was known as "Truck". He played with lots of musicians including Muggsy Spanier, Herbie Fields, and Louie Bellson. He kept playing music even when he was very old and was part of a band in 2000.

Even though "Truck" Parham was a very good musician, he never made his own music album. He always played as part of a band. He played a lot of Dixieland jazz music in his career. He worked with Art Hodes a lot in the 1960s. Some of the albums he helped make are "Drumorama!" and "The Brilliant Bellson Sound" with Louis Bellson and "Hodes' Art" and "Friar's Inn Revisited" with Art Hodes.
