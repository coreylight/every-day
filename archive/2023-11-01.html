    <h2>Musician of the Day: Bob Belden</h2>
    <p id="musician">Bob Belden was a famous American musician who played the saxophone. He also wrote a lot of music and even won a really cool award, the Grammy, for his jazz album called 'Black Dahlia' in 2001. Bob Belden did not only play and write music, but he also helped make older recordings sound better, especially songs by another famous musician named Miles Davis.

Bob Belden was born in Evanston, Illinois but grew up in South Carolina. He went to school to study music and then joined a band. He created his first album, 'Treasure Island', in 1990. He also put together a special project called 'Miles from India' in 2008, which blended American and Indian music. Bob Belden passed away in 2015, but left behind lots of great music for us to enjoy.</p>
