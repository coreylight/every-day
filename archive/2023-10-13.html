    <h2>Musician of the Day: Luciano Pavarotti</h2>
    <p id="musician">Luciano Pavarotti was a very famous singer from Italy who was known for his strong, beautiful voice. He was most popular for singing operaâ€” a kind of music that tells a story through songsâ€”but later in his career he also sang popular music. He was known as one of the greatest tenors of all time and his nickname was "King of the High Cs."

Everybody knew who Pavarotti was after he performed in a group called the Three Tenors during the 1990 World Cup football tournament. He sang in many concerts that were shown on t.v. and his music albums sold over 100 million copies! Mr. Pavarotti was also a kind man who did a lot of charity work to help people. He passed away in 2007.</p>
