    <p id="musician">Bryce Rohde was a musician from Australia who loved to play and write jazz music on the piano. He was also inspired by another musician named George Russell. Bryce Rohde was born in a place called Hobart, in Tasmania, and he started playing jazz music in another place called Adelaide. He then moved to Canada in 1953.

During his amazing career, Bryce formed a group called the Australian Jazz Quartet with two other people from Australia and one from America in 1954. They made a lot of music and even went on a tour in the United States! Unfortunately, the group split up in 1958, but Bryce continued to make his own music. He moved to California in 1965 and kept leading his own groups of musicians, including people like Bruce Cale and Charlie Munro. Sadly, Bryce Rohde passed away in 2016.</p>
