    <p id="musician">Margo Timmins is a very important member of a music band from Canada called Cowboy Junkies. She was born on January 27, 1961, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and grew up with her brothers, Michael and Peter, who also play in the band. She is the main singer, and her dreamy singing combined with the band's simple and calm music make the band sound very special and unique. 

Margo was one of six kids in her family and she spent her childhood in Montreal. Her mom, Barbara, was very sure of herself and taught Margo to be the same way, not worrying too much about what others think. Her dad, John, worked in business, but he loved music very much. This love for music rubbed off on his children especially on Michael, Margo's brother. The love for music in her family inspired Margo and her brothers to start their own band.</p><p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1HjqJH5ljPcdHocr5sOkDl" id="link-spotify" target="_blank">Listen to Margo Timmins on Spotify ðŸŽ¶</a></p>
